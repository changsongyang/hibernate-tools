# Hibernate Tools Gradle : 5 Minute Tutorial

The best way to get to know the Hibernate Tools Gradle plugin is to start to use it. 
Hence we will provide a quick tutorial that gives you the first taste of it.
Before tackling this tutorial, make sure you have the [Gradle](https://gradle.org) build tool 
[installed](https://gradle.org/install/) and available on your machine.

## Create a Gradle Java Project

Letâ€™s assume in this case that we start off with a very simple default Gradle Java application
that we create from a command-line window with the instruction below. 

```
gradle init --type java-application --dsl groovy
```

Gradle will ask you some details about your application. The conversation is shown below
for completenes but of course you can make your own choices.

```
Enter target Java version (min: 7, default: 21): 

Project name (default: 5-minute-tutorial): 

Select application structure:
  1: Single application project
  2: Application and library project
Enter selection (default: Single application project) [1..2] 1

Select test framework:
  1: JUnit 4
  2: TestNG
  3: Spock
  4: JUnit Jupiter
Enter selection (default: JUnit Jupiter) [1..4] 4

Generate build using new APIs and behavior (some features may change in the next minor release)? (default: no) [yes, no]
