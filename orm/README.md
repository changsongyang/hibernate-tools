# Hibernate Tools ORM

This project contains API and an implementation that allow you to perform reverse engineering on existing databases and generate artifacts such as JPA classes or Hibernate mapping files from the database information. 

The tools in this module can be used as you like in your code but for your convenience they have been wrapped in a number of [Hibernate Tools Ant tasks](../ant) and in a [Hibernate Tools Maven plugin](../maven).
